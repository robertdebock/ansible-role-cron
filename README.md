Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  vars:
    cron_jobs:
      - name: requested job
        job: "ls -alh > /dev/null"
      - name: requested job by the minute
        minute: "23"
        job: "ls -alh > /dev/null"
      - name: requested job by the hour
        hour: "23"
        job: "ls -alh > /dev/null"
      - name: requested job by the weekday
        weekday: "1"
        job: "ls -alh > /dev/null"

  roles:
    - robertdebock.cron
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
```

Testing is done using [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule):

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tests multiple ansible versions.
[Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule) tests multiple distributions.

To test using the defaults (any installed ansible version, namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`):

```
molecule test

# Or select a specific image:
image=ubuntu molecule test
# Or select a specific image and a specific tag:

```

Or you can test multiple versions of Ansible, and select images:
Tox allows multiple versions of Ansible to be tested. To run the default (namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`) tests:
